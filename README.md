Customer Churn Analysis Using Shifted Beta-Geometric Model
Overview
This repository contains an advanced churn analysis project utilizing the Shifted Beta-Geometric (sBG) model. It's tailored to uncover in-depth insights into customer retention and churn patterns, particularly beneficial for businesses with subscription-based models. The project encapsulates a complete workflow from data preprocessing to detailed statistical modeling and financial impact assessment.

Contents
churn_analysis.py: The core Python script encompassing all analytical functions and the model.
rich_sample_data.csv: The sample dataset, forming the basis of our churn analysis.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Rigorous data cleaning and preparation, focusing on specific customer segments.
Cohort-Based Analysis: Detailed grouping of customers to track retention and churn over time.
Survival Analysis via sBG Model: Implementation and optimization of the sBG model to predict customer lifespan.
Financial Implications: Comprehensive calculations of key financial metrics like ARPU, lifetime value, and profitability.
Extensive Timeframe Analysis: Long-term prediction capabilities extending up to 120 months.
Conditional Probability Metrics: Advanced metrics to understand churn post-initial customer retention period.

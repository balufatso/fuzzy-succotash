# Customer Churn Analysis Using Shifted Beta-Geometric Model

## Overview
This repository contains an advanced churn analysis project utilizing the Shifted Beta-Geometric (sBG) model. It's tailored to uncover in-depth insights into customer retention and churn patterns, particularly beneficial for businesses with subscription-based models. The project encapsulates a complete workflow from data preprocessing to detailed statistical modeling and financial impact assessment.

## Contents
- `churn_analysis.py`: The core Python script encompassing all analytical functions and the model.
- `rich_sample_data.csv`: The sample dataset, forming the basis of our churn analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Rigorous data cleaning and preparation, focusing on specific customer segments.
- **Cohort-Based Analysis**: Detailed grouping of customers to track retention and churn over time.
- **Survival Analysis via sBG Model**: Implementation and optimization of the sBG model to predict customer lifespan.
- **Financial Implications**: Comprehensive calculations of key financial metrics like ARPU, lifetime value, and profitability.
- **Extensive Timeframe Analysis**: Long-term prediction capabilities extending up to 120 months.
- **Conditional Probability Metrics**: Advanced metrics to understand churn post-initial customer retention period.
